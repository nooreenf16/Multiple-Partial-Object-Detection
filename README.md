Abstract
The idea is to use a simple image processing angeometric operation to identify the
location of objects in an image. This is done by segmenting all objects, doing image reconstruction
and performing a detection algorithm on each. The entire project will be done in Python, using
its libraries, which include: openCV, NumPy, sklearn/tensorflow, YOLO algorithm, and more. I have used YOLO algorithm for the detection
(which I will elaborate further later in the paper), however it has 2 major disadvantages: [gj]
• it cannot identify partially covered objects always.
• it cannot identify objects at an angle always.
These disadvantages are what I have attempted to solve using multiple Image Processing techniques
along with developing a software with a real world application.The idea is to use a simple image processing angeometric operation to identify the location of objects in an image.
